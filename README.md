## Usage
As part of the city's commitment to sustainability and environmental awareness, all buildings are required to disclose their energy efficiency scores, represented by a letter grade, ranging from A to D, with A being the most energy-efficient and D indicating lower energy efficiency. 

## Features
The webpage shows a list of buildings in all five boroughs of the city of New York sorted by their energy efficiency grade. These grades reflect the building's overall energy performance and serve as an important indicator of its environmental impact. By making these grades publicaly available, New York City aims to promote transparency, necourage energy-concious practices, and empower individuals and communities to make informed choices for a greener future.
